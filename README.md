What is auto roblox? Auto roblox is an application that if you crash while you are afk grinding in a game, you will be sent right back.
But can't I just set an auto clicker? Yes, you can but theres always a high risk chance of you crashing.

To run Auto_Roblox you need to be in a roblox game first, and then all you need to simply do is run it! And now once you crash you will be put back into the game.
